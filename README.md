# EchoServer

Swift-NIO EchoServer example.

This repository accompanies the article [Developing a Basic Swift Echo Server Using SwiftNIO](https://www.process-one.net/blog/developing-a-basic-swift-echo-server-using-swift-nio/).
Please note that the code here has diverged from the article, as it has been modernized to work with the latest versions of Swift and Xcode.

For similar and always up-to-date examples, refer to the SwiftNIO source tree:

- [NIOTCPEchoClient](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources/NIOTCPEchoClient);
- [NIOTCPEchoServer](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources/NIOTCPEchoServer).

If you’re new to SwiftNIO, it’s worth exploring the [Sources folder of SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources) for more practical examples. You may also find Apple’s separate [swift-nio-examples](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-examples) repository useful.
